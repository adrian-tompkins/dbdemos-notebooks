# MAGIC ## 6 Dashboard for Model Output and Optimisation Visualisation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Having run our model to generate the predicted Fe and Si concentrate, we can store plot the observations to visually see how effective the predictions are.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We can also store the optimisations for the Fe concentrate to see how our model optimisation tracks against the observed data for the out of time dataset.
